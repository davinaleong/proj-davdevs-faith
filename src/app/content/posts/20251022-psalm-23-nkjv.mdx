The Lord the Shepherd of His People<br/>
A Psalm of David.

23 The Lord is my shepherd;<br/>
I shall not want.<br/>
2 He makes me to lie down in green pastures;<br/>
He leads me beside the still waters.<br/>
3 He restores my soul;<br/>
He leads me in the paths of righteousness<br/>
For His name’s sake.

4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,<br/>
I will fear no evil;<br/>
For You are with me;<br/>
Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.

5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;<br/>
You anoint my head with oil;<br/>
My cup runs over.<br/>
6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me<br/>
All the days of my life;<br/>
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord<br/>
Forever.
