> Proverbs 2:10-12 NKJV

> 10 When wisdom enters your heart,<br/>
> And knowledge is pleasant to your soul,<br/>
> 11 Discretion will preserve you;<br/>
> Understanding will keep you,<br/>
> 12 To deliver you from the way of evil,<br/>
> From the man who speaks perverse things,

Signs that you’ve received wisdom: knowledge is pleasant to your soul. Discretion will preserve you and understanding will keep you

In other words, wisdom can deliver you from the way of evil
