The Way of the Righteous and the End of the Ungodly

1 Blessed is the man
Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly,<br/>>
Nor stands in the path of sinners,<br/>
Nor sits in the seat of the scornful;<br/>
2 But his delight is in the law of the Lord,<br/>
And in His law he meditates day and night.<br/>
3 He shall be like a tree<br/>
Planted by the rivers of water,<br/>
That brings forth its fruit in its season,<br/>
Whose leaf also shall not wither;<br/>
And whatever he does shall prosper.

4 The ungodly are not so,<br/>
But are like the chaff which the wind drives away.<br/>
5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment,<br/>
Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

6 For the Lord knows the way of the righteous,<br/>
But the way of the ungodly shall perish.
