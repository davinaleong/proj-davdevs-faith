Hey fellow foodies! Don’t we all enjoy good food? Well, just like when we must be fed physically, we must be fed spiritually too!

And do you realise how AMAZING your good Shepherd, Christ Jesus is? What sheep eat? Grass right? You know what your good Shephred does? He “makes you to lie down in green pastures”. Do you know what this means for sheep? It means really juicy, delicious, soft grass! Not only that, but “makes you to lie down”. That means rest.

Then here comes the water part. YOUR good Shepherd “leads you beside still waters”. That means He leads the sheep to sources of fresh water. Y’know, fresh spring water.

What this means is your good Shepherd watches over you and will ensure that you will be well fed and quenched. Just keep coming to Him—to church. Which is why you can “do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink”, amen!
