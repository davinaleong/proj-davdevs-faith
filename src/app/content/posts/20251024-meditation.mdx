The world teaches you that meditation means to empty your mind. Do you notice how this works? Watching TV and scrolling through social media aimlessly. Now, there’s nothing wrong with these things. Just don’t let it affect your peace

Jesus’ meditation is to fill your mind with what Your Daddy God says and thinks about you. Here are some examples:

    1.	I am fearfully (meticulously) and wonderfully made - Psalm 139:14
    1.	I can do all things through Christ Who strengthens me - Philippians 4:13
    1.	For by You, I can run upon a troop; And by my God I can leap over a wall - Psalm 18:29
    1.	For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.” - Hebrews 8:12
    1.	He Himself has said, “I will never leave you nor forsake you.” - Hebrews 13:5

Amongst many more verses in the Bible that tells you of your Daddy’s love and justice for you. So, deliberately choose to meditate on your Daddy’s love for you, amen? Especially when you’re going through a trial, challenge or temptation. Jesus bless you always, 😁
