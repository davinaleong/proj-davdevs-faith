We are the church and Jesus is our Husband. His fury is aroused when that little devil comes to bully you. He will not be spared in the day of vengeance. Though the devil may give many gifts to Him, He will accept no recompense

So stand still and see the salvation of the Lord your God, amen! (Exo 14:13)
