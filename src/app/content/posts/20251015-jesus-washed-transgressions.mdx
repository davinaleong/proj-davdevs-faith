> Proverbs 17:9 NKJV
>
> He who covers a transgression seeks love,<br/>
> But he who repeats a matter separates friends.

In this verse, it says that one who covers a transgression seeks love. That is at man’s level. Man at most can cover a transgression.

But do you know that there’s even greater news now in the New Covenant? The perfect Man, Christ Jesus didn’t just cover your transgressions—He washed them all away with His precious blood.

So, count on your forgiveness, paid for by the perfect Man Who is now, right now, seated at the right-hand of your big, big Daddy God making intercessions for you, amen!
