> 1 Corinthians 12:7-11 NKJV
> 
> 7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all: 
> 
> 8 for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit, 
> 
> 9 to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit, 
> 
> 10 to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. 
> 
> 11 But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills.
