Hey friends, may I encourage you all to give time to the Lord when you can every day, even if it’s only 5 min?

From reading the word or daily devo to talking to him, to listening to Christian music, to watching a sermon on YouTube, get into the word, for it is the incorruptible seed of the word of God which lives and abides forever

I can testify to how spending time with the Lord has blessed and benefitted me much in my life. Not that I do it to earn His blessings but do it with the mentality that I CANNOT live without Him. The time when I am dry, is because I neglected my quiet time with Him. Recently, people have been commenting on my good complexion. Not to put a feather on my cap, but the Lord told me, it’s because of all the time I spend with Him, and His eternal youth rubs onto me.

So, guys, let’s spend time to read the Word of God, amen!
