> Proverbs 17:8 NKJV
> 
> 8 A present is a precious stone in the eyes of its possessor;<br />
> Wherever he turns, he prospers.

> Exodus 28:17-21 NKJV
> 
> 17 And you shall put settings of stones in it, four rows of stones: The first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and an emerald; this shall be the first row;<br />
> 18 the second row shall be a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond;<br />
> 19 the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;<br />
> 20 and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. They shall be set in gold settings.<br />
> 21 And the stones shall have the names of the sons of Israel, twelve according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, each one with its own name; they shall be according to the twelve tribes.

For those who’ve been in church since the days at Suntec City, did you remember the sermon Pastor Prince preached on the high priest and on the breastplate or ephod?

What are the items set in gold settings? The precious stones right? They represent us. Then in the Proverbs verse, it says, “A present is a precious stone”.  So if we are the precious stones, then we are presents. 

And Who is our Possessor? Jesus! So we are presents (precious stones) to Him. Wherever He turns us, we prosper, amen!
