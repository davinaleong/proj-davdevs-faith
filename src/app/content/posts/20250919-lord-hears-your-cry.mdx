> Psalm 34:15 NKJV
>
> The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,<br/>
> And His ears are open to their cry.

When you receive Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, you receive the gift of righteousness and no condemnation.

So, this verse says that the eyes of the Lord are on you, you righteous one. His ears are open to your cry!

So cry out to Him in your troubled times. Hold fast to Him knowing that Heâ€™s always watching over you, amen?!
