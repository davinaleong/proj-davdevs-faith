> Ephesians 5:27 NKJV
> 
> 27 that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish.

Hello people! Here’s another sermon for YOU!

Do you know how Jesus sees you? He sees you holy and without blemish! He is your Bridegroom. Do you know what this means?

It’s all the more important that we get into anointed sermons on the gospel of grace that remind us of Jesus’ finished work on the cross and its benefits for us so that when that puny little bully, the devil tries to accuse you to yourself, you know deep down in your heart the truth about how Jesus sees you: holy and without blemish. This is the truth that shall set you free from the clutches of the enemy. 

So, let’s keep getting into and meditating on the rhema Word of Christ, amen!
