Hey fam 👋! Here’s another revelation for you—birthed out of a recent experience. 

I was recently reprimanded by my boss on task where I misunderstood the scope and hence, missed the deadline. 

Then today, as I was resting and listening to sermons from Joyce Meyer, the Lord (and my Lover) reminded me of these verses. That those that “Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him”, but, “whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come”

What these verses mean is this: anyone who curses or blasphemes against Jesus shall be forgiven. But those that blaspheme against the church in whom the Holy Spirit dwell in shall not be forgiven. Then in “this age” means during the age Jesus walked, and “in the age to come” means the age after Jesus ascends to heaven. 

So, brothers and sisters in Christ, do not fear, do not falter in the day of adversity, for your Daddy God and Good Shepherd watch over you. When people persecute you, just shine and walk away and pray for them and let God handle your enemies for Jesus Himself has promised that those who blaspheme against you shall not be forgiven.
