> 
> 11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives to the death.

Hey fam 👋! Here’s another revelation for you—birthed out of a recent experience. 

Hey friends! Here’s another revelation for YOU!

This verse is our reality. We’re living it right now! Every time we partake of the Holy Communion, we’re overcoming the devil by the blood of the Lamb. 

Then we hear so often Pastor Gabriel sharing testimonies of people being set free when they believe right. That is them (and us) overcoming the devil by the word of their (and our) testimony. 

And we do love our lives to the death for we love our Lord Christ Jesus. We love Him because He first loved us, amen!
