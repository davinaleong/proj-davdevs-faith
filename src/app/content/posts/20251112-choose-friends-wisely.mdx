Hey there! Here’s another word of wisdom for you. Be wise with who you hangout with. 

While we don’t give the holier-than-thou attitude to the world, we should learn to abstain from some of the worldly activities that they do because we are the temple of the Holy Spirit and ambassadors of Christ. 

Why would you want to party at a bar when we have singing and dancing in the Father’s house? Give up gossiping and speak well of people instead—see the gold in them. Drinking? No need. We have the Holy Scriptures to quench our thirst. Hungry? Haha… Jesus has blessed us with such amazing pastors who feed us the rhema word of God every Sunday. 

So, hangout with godly counsel. People who point you and remind you of Jesus, amen!
