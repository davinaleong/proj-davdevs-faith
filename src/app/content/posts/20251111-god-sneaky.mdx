> 1 Samuel 17:8 NKJV
> 
> 8 Then he stood and cried out to the armies of Israel, and said to them, “Why have you come out to line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and you the servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.

The devil is loud and proud. Jesus is deliberate and silent. 

Hey, if you’re in a challenge and feel like Jesus is silent, know that He is moving for you and fighting your battles for you. He might even be sending His champion to you!

While the Israelites were trembling at the threats of Goliath, Jesus was moving through Samuel, Jesse, and David, and was sending His own champion, David—the beloved. 

You see, all Goliath the Philistine saw in Israel were the “servants of Saul”. Not “servants of Yahweh” because if he did, I’m sure he would’ve trembled. But God was moving silently through Jesse and David to not just destroy Goliath, but utterly wipeout the Philistines. 

So, stand still and see the salvation of your Lord, and Saviour, Christ Jesus, amen!
