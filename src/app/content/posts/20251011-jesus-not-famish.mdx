Get fed hungry children of Christ! While the verse may refer to a physical famine that the author (most likely Solomon) faced, this verse can also refer to spiritual famine.

Your Lord and Saviour Christ Jesus will not allow you who is righteous by faith to be famished. For He will make you to lie down in green pastures and lead you beside still waters (Psa 23:2 NKJV)

And do you know—realise just how much good food Jesus has given us—YOU?! From traditional chapels to modern theatres. From small tight-knit churches to mega churches. From formal, great-for-studying translations to simple ones. If that’s not enough, your big big Daddy God has given you so many anointed men and women of God to break down the word and feed you. And above it all, the Holy Spirit will teach you all things (John 14:26)

So, be sure to plant yourself in a church that preaches from the Bible!
