> Psalm 84:10 NKJV

> 10 For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand.<br/>
> I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God<br/>
> Than dwell in the tents of wickedness.

As we are nearing the holiday season for 2025, let’s remember the main reason for the season: that our Lord Christ Jesus was born to die a cruel death on the cross to redeem us from the clutches of hell. 

A moment spent with Jesus can be the next miracle waiting to happen in your life.

Sometimes we can get caught up in our work that we forget to sit still and just have a quiet time with Him. It doesn’t have to be long. It can even be just 5 min reading the daily devotional, and then suddenly you find rest and acceleration in what you have to do: from piles of work to housework, to looking after your children. 

Jesus is a debtor to no man. Whatever you give to Him is not wasted. It’ll be multiplied back to you. 

So, let’s remember to follow the prompting when the Holy Spirit prompts us to spend time with Him, amen.
