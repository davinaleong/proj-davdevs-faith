> Proverbs 22:11 NKJV
>
> He who loves purity of heart<br/>
> And has grace on his lips,<br/>
> The king will be his friend.

He who has purity of heart and grace on his lips, Jesus (the king) in this passage will be his friend.

This is not to mistake your identity in Christ or the believe that you may lose your salvation. In a believer’s journey, salvation is the starting point. No matter what you do, your home is Heaven, and you will go to Heaven. However, what you do here on earth until you reach there affects your experience.

As Pastor Joseph Prince has preached before, God loves all unconditionally, but there are some who He likes. And do you know who He likes? Those who have a “purity of heart” and “grace on his lips”.

BUT! Do not put the pressure on yourself. Put it on the Holy Spirit to transform you. So, let’s ask, seek, and knock for a “pure heart” and a “graceful tongue” not to please God or man, but to bring glory to our amazing Saviour, and Lord, Christ Jesus, amen!
