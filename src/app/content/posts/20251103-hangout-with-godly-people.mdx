> Psalm 1:1 NKJV
> 
> Blessed is the man<br/>
> Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly,<br/>
> Nor stands in the path of sinners,<br/>
> Nor sits in the seat of the scornful;

If you want what you do to prosper, do these: Keep away from the counsel of the ungodly, stay away from the path of sinners, and don’t sit in the seat of the scornful

In other words, don’t adhere to worldly advice, don’t follow the ways of the world, and don’t sit with gossipers. Do these 3 things and what you do will prosper
