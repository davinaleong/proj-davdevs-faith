> Jeremiah 18:6 NKJV
>
> “O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter?” says the Lord. “Look, as the clay is in the potter’s hand, so are you in My hand, O house of Israel!

I was listening to Joyce Meyer when she mentioned “soft clay”. I also know these facts: with water, the clay becomes soft and mouldable. But remove the water, and the clay becomes hard and even brittle. That’s what happens when pottery go into the oven. They become hard, and when dropped, they break into many pieces

We are like clay in our big, big Daddy’s hands. The water is the rhema word of God. The times when we feel energised on Sundays is because we’ve been washed and watered by Jesus. The times when we feel like we’re in the wilderness or in the desert is because we’ve neglected the word of God

So, let’s keep ourselves watered by the rhema word, amen!
