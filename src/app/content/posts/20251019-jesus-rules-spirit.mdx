> Proverbs 16:32 NKJV
>
> He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty,<br/>
> And he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.

One who is slow to anger is better than a warrior (or soldier). And he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city

Do you know who this verse is referring to? It’s our Lord Christ Jesus. Jesus is the one Who is slow to anger. He also rules His spirit which was shown on the cross when He dismissed His spirit before bowing His head

Being slow to anger is to have long-suffering or patience which is one of the fruits of the Holy Spirit. And He who rules his spirit is to have the fruit of self-control, another fruit of the Holy Spirit

BUT! That’s not all, through Christ we can have them too while beholding the Jesus, we will be transformed into His image for we are made in God’s, Your Creator’s image (Gen 1:27), amen!
