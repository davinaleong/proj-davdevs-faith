Safety of Abiding in the Presence of God

91 He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High<br/>
Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.<br/>
2 I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress;<br/>
My God, in Him I will trust.”

3 Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler<br/>
And from the perilous pestilence.<br/>
4 He shall cover you with His feathers,<br/>
And under His wings you shall take refuge;<br/>
His truth shall be your shield and buckler.<br/>
5 You shall not be afraid of the terror by night,<br/>
Nor of the arrow that flies by day,<br/>
6 Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness,<br/>
Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday.

7 A thousand may fall at your side,<br/>
And ten thousand at your right hand;<br/>
But it shall not come near you.<br/>
8 Only with your eyes shall you look,<br/>
And see the reward of the wicked.

9 Because you have made the Lord, who is my refuge,<br/>
Even the Most High, your dwelling place,<br/>
10 No evil shall befall you,<br/>
Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling;<br/>
11 For He shall give His angels charge over you,<br/>
To keep you in all your ways.<br/>
12 In their hands they shall bear you up,<br/>
Lest you dash your foot against a stone.<br/>
13 You shall tread upon the lion and the cobra,<br/>
The young lion and the serpent you shall trample underfoot.

14 “Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore I will deliver him;<br/>
I will set him on high, because he has known My name.<br/>
15 He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him;<br/>
I will be with him in trouble;<br/>
I will deliver him and honor him.<br/>
16 With long life I will satisfy him,<br/>
And show him My salvation.”
