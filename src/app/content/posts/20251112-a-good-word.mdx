> But a good word makes it glad.

Hey all, here’s something I want to share on something I’ve been practicing on my own: be generous in your compliments. 

Stop that Pharisaical, holier-than-thou attitude. We all deserve hell. But Jesus died a cruel death to save us. 

Being kind doesn’t take much. You can start by thanking and complimenting the people around you. 

Examples: thanking the waiter or cashier that served you. Complimenting your best friend or spouse. Thanking the colleague who did you a favour. Praying for your superiors and team. Texting a person who’s going through a difficult season. In other words, go out of your way to be generous with your words. Not all of us have the budget to bless people monetarily. But we can definitely be generous with our thanksgiving and compliments. 

Because you never know how just one good word can make a man’s heart glad, amen!
