Hey all, as I was taking a break today after reaching a good milestone at work, I was meditating on Jesus feeding the five thousand. 

Then it dawned on me: in concept this is the outcome of believing right. Of reckoning that Jesus is good, all-powerful, and ever willing and ever ready to bless us. The beginning of it is things like tithing and sowing. Give your 10% to Jesus and witness Him multiply the 90% to bless the 5 thousand through you. Partake of the tiny crumb of bread, and a small cup of wine or juice and testify when Jesus uses that to multiply healing and health in your body. Seeds are tiny, but they grow into strong plants like trees. 

Be blessed and stay blessed, amen!
