> 1 Peter 2:6 NKJV
>
> Therefore it is also contained in the Scripture,<br/>
> “Behold, I lay in Zion<br/>
> A chief cornerstone, elect, precious,<br/>
> And he who believes on Him will by no means be put to shame.”

Do not be ashamed of Jesus for the Bible says those who put their trust in Him shall not be put to shame. Also this verse also mentions that through Christ Jesus, you are the elect, precious in Him.

So rejoice and put your trust in Jesus, especially when you are going through a challenging time. He will never fail you and let your countenance fall, amen!
